> QUESTIONS
> - Is there a correlation between self-care habits , or lifestyle factors with the diagnosis of
diabetes in a patient.
> - Is HDI something that can be correlated with diabetes diagnosis of a patient.

> Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/views/2039934_CS5803/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

> INSIGHTS

> - Interesting HDI trends are observed between diabetic and non-diabetic population.
> - Basically diagnosis of diabetes points towards a lower HDI.
> - Self care practices are more prevalent in diabetics than non-diabetics. Males are more
vigilant than females.
> - Lifestyle choices of heavy alcohol consumption or smoking do not point towards a
substantial correlation. In fact whether diabetic or non diabetic, more people opt for a
healthier lifestyle than indulging themselves abusively.

> CRITICAL REFLECTIONS

> - The population of diabetics and non-diabetics was not balanced and hence comparison
between the two could only be done on a proportion of the total basis.
> - Lack of exact numerical data and presence of interval data instead (for income, education
and age) is a bit inconvenient for the calculation of dimension indices and for final
calculation of Human Development Index (HDI). This kind of calculation can be done in
Tableau too.
> - The above is not just inconvenient but also more inaccurate than it would have been with
exact data.
> - HDI is an indicator of life expectancy and standard of living and not of inequality or
poverty and hence its correlation with diabetes diagnosis does not imply any lack of
financial resources.
